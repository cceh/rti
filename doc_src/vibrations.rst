 Vibration Reduction
=====================

Camera vibration during exposure reduce sharpness.  The effect gets more noticeable with
longer exposure times.  To reduce vibrations use a solid tripod to mount the camera.

Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras use a mirror to deflect the light into the
viewfinder.  This mirror obscures the sensor and therefore must be lifted before
the camera can take an exposure.  The lifting of the mirror causes the camera to
vibrate slightly, even if the camera is mounted on a tripod\ [#]_.  To reduce
these vibrations use live view or exposure delay mode.


Live View
=========

In live view mode the camera does not use the viewfinder at all and the mirror
will be locked in the *up* position.  This mode, when implemented correctly\ [#]_,
can greatly reduce camera vibrations.

Another advantage of live view ist that you can attach a HDMI monitor to your
camera and preview the picture on a big screen.


Exposure Delay Mode
===================

Use this mode if live view is not available or broken.  This mode delays taking
the picture after lifting the mirror until most of the vibrations have damped.

Exposure delay mode does incur in a speed penalty but this penalty is small because
you must also subtract the time it takes the camera to write the picture to the
memory card.


Mirrorless Cameras
==================

Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Cameras (MILC) do not have mirrors and thus are
a suitable alternative to the more common (as of 2018) SLR type.  The lenses for
MILC cameras as a rule are not compatible with SLR type lenses and, being
comparatively new, the choice of lenses is more limited (but there are adapters).


Footnotes
=========

.. [#] The shutter movement also causes the camera to vibrate, but the shutter
       is much lighter than the mirror assembly.  The shutter is essential to
       camera operation and thus cannot be avoided.

.. [#] Live view on the Nikon D700 is useless as it does not keep the mirror up
       between shots.
