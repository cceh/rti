RTI Dome User Manual
====================


Camera Settings
---------------

1. **Set the file format to RAW or JPEG.** Nikon: :guilabel:`QUAL` +
   :guilabel:`rear dial`.

2. **Set the white balance.** If you are not shooting RAW set the white balance
   to incandescent light.  Nikon: :guilabel:`WB` + :guilabel:`rear dial`.  If
   you shoot RAW this setting is not used by the camera.

3. **Set the ISO sensitivity.** Use the ISO setting with least noise.  Nikon:
   :guilabel:`ISO` + :guilabel:`rear dial`.  All cameras have one ISO setting
   where the sensor noise is minimal, usually the lowest, but you should check
   with your camera manual.

4. **Set the camera to manual focus.** Nikon: Push the switch on the lens from
   :guilabel:`M/A` to :guilabel:`M`.

5. **Set the camera to manual exposure.** Nikon: :guilabel:`MODE` +
   :guilabel:`rear dial`.  Use the smallest aperture for maximum focus depth.
   Nikon: :guilabel:`front dial`.  Set the time.  Nikon: :guilabel:`rear dial`.
   You'll have to adjust the settings after taking test run.  The focus light
   has not the same intensity as the flash light.  Check for overexposure
   especially with shiny objects.

6. **Turn on exposure delay mode.** Nikon D700: menu :menuselection:`d9`.  This
   mode waits 1 second after lifting the mirror and before actually taking the
   picture thus reducing vibrations.


Dome Setup
----------

1. **Connect the RTI dome to the CRM 114** (Camera to RTI Module) using two
   Cat.5 or better Ethernet cables.

2. **Fit lens and camera to the dome.** Align the camera's vertical axis with
   the 0Â° axis of dome.  A polarizing filter between dome and lens will allow
   you to turn the camera with more ease.

   .. warning::

      You will not get working RTI pictures without correct alignment of dome
      and camera.

3. **Connect the camera to the CRM** using two interface cables.  Connect the
   PC-Flash output on the camera with the flash input on the CRM.  Connect the
   trigger input on the camera with the trigger output on the CRM.

4. **Connect the AC/DC adaptor to the CRM** and plug it into a wall socket.  The
   green light on the CRM should come on.

5. **Turn the camera on.**


Shooting
--------

1. **Put the object under the dome** in the exact center.

2. **Short press the green button** for focus light.  You can short press again
   to turn the focus light off.

3. **Focus the object.** Then close the viewfinder.

4. **Long press the green button** to start the picture run.

The red button resets the CRM.  Use it to abort a shooting run.


Various Notes
-------------

Your mileage will mostly depend on how fast the camera can save the pictures
to the memory card.  Many cameras have an internal buffer, which fills up
after a short burst.

Shoot RAW for highest quality.  If you shoot RAW you have to post-process the
files in a raw converter software, but you can make corrections in the
process.

If you shoot JPEG the camera will post-process the files for you, and you
cannot make corrections.

RAW files are much bigger and thus slower than JPEGs.

Camera vibrations caused by mirror movement can impair the results.  To
reduce camera vibrations use exposure delay mode or live view.

Exposure delay mode does not incur a penalty of one second per exposure.
Depending on the speed of the memory card it may be much less.  If shooting
RAW with a slow memory card the camera will need more than one second to
write the file, thus the penalty will be zero.

For greater focus depth use the smallest aperture (that is the *highest*
aperture number) that you can manage.  Most cameras use the largest aperture
for viewing, the focus depth you see in the viewfinder is much less than the
depth you will get on the picture.  In case of a 3D object focus on the
middle ground.

If you want color, place the object onto a grey card.  This will make it a
lot easier to find the correct white balance in the raw converter software.
