RTI Dome User Manual
====================


Camera Settings
---------------

1. **Set the file format to RAW or JPEG.**  Nikon: Button QUAL + rear dial.
   Shoot RAW for highest quality.  If you shoot RAW you have to post-process the
   files in a raw converter software, but you can better make corrections in the
   process.  If you shoot JPEG the camera will post-process the files for you,
   but you cannot easily change what the camera did.  Information may already be
   lost.

2. **Set the ISO sensitivity.** Use the ISO setting with least noise.  All
   cameras have one ISO setting where the sensor noise in minimal, usually the
   lowest, but you should check with your camera manual.

3. **Set the white balance.**  If you are not shooting RAW set the white balance to
   incandescent light.  If you shoot RAW this setting is not used by the camera
   (but you'll have to set it in the raw converter software).

4. **Set the camera to manual focus.**  Nikon: Push the switch on the lens from M/A
   to M.

5. **Set the camera to manual exposure.**  Nikon: MODE button + rear dial.  Use the
   smallest aperture for maximum focus depth.  Nikon: front dial.  Set the time.
   Nikon: rear dial.  You'll have to adjust the settings after taking test run.
   The focus light has not the same intensity as the flash light.

6. **Turn on exposure delay mode.** Nikon D700: menu d9.  This mode waits 1
   second after lifting the mirror and before actually taking the picture thus
   reducing vibrations.  N.B. This mode incurs a speed penalty of less than one
   second per exposure, depending on the speed of the memory card.  Shooting RAW
   with a slow memory card the camera will need more than 1 second to write the
   file, thus the penalty will be zero.


Dome Setup
----------

Connect the RTI dome to the CRM 114 (Camera to RTI Module) using two Cat.5 or
better Ethernet cables.

Fit lens and camera to the dome.  Align the camera vertical axis with the 0Â° of
dome.

.. warning::

   You will not get working RTI pictures without correct alignment of dome and
   camera.

Connect the camera to the CRM using two interface cables.  Connect the PC-Flash
output on the camera with the flash input on the CRM.  Connect the trigger input
on the camera with the trigger output on the CRM.

Connect the AC/DC adaptor to the CRM and plug it into a wall socket.  The green
light on the CRM should come on.

Turn the camera on.


Shooting
--------

1. Put the object under the dome in the exact center.

2. Short press the green button for focus light. Focus the object.

3. Short press the green button again to turn the focus light off.

4. Long press the green button to start the picture run.

5. The red button resets the CRM.  Use it to abort a shooting run.


Various Notes
-------------

The speed depends on how fast the camera can save the pictures to the memory
card.  RAW files are much bigger and thus slower than JPEGs, but RAW files
contain more information which may be valuable in postprocessing.

Camera vibrations caused by mirror movement can impair the results.  To
reduce camera vibrations use exposure delay mode or live view.

.. note::

   For greater focus depth use the smallest aperture (that is the *highest*
   aperture number) that you can manage.  Most cameras use the largest aperture
   for viewing, the focus depth you see in the viewfinder is much less than the
   depth you will get on the picture.  In case of a 3D object focus on the
   middle ground.

.. note::

   If you want color, place the object onto a grey card.  This will make it a
   lot easier to find the correct white balance in the raw converter software.
