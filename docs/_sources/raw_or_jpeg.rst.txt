 RAW or JPEG?
==============

Use :term:`RAW` files for highest quality or use JPEG files for speed and
convenience.


RAW
===

RAW files are much larger and thus slower to work with than JPEGs.  RAW files are
losslessly compressed and retain the full sensor resolution of 12 or 14 bits per
RGB channel.

RAW files must be post-processed in a raw converter software, which is
time-consuming, but you can make many corrections in the process, like adjusting
color according to a color swatch.

Prefer RAW if no other pictures exist of the object you are imaging.  RAW files
convert to TIFF for archival purposes.


JPEG
====

JPEG files are smaller and thus faster to work with than RAW files.  JPEGs are
lossily compressed and retain only 8 bits resolution per RGB channel.

If you shoot JPEG the camera will post-process the files for you, but you are
limited in the corrections you can make afterwards.

Use JPEG if the only purpose of taking these images is to build an RTI image and
there exist other images of the object for archival purposes.
