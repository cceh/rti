RTI Dome User Manual
====================

Before taking an RTI image you must :ref:`decide on which lens to use <lenses>`
and if you will be shooting :term:`RAW` images or JPEGs.

Use :term:`RAW` files for highest quality or use JPEG files for speed and
convenience.

RAW files are much bigger and thus slower to work with than JPEGs.  But much
information is lost in the JPEG files that is in the RAW files.  RAW files are
losslessly compressed and retain the full sensor resolution of 12 or 14 bits per
RGB channel.  JPEG files are lossily compressed and have only 8 bits resolution
per RGB channel.

You must post-process RAW files in a raw converter software, but you can make
many corrections in the process, like setting the white point on each picture
individually for best color fidelity.

If you shoot JPEG the camera will post-process the files for you, but you cannot
make corrections afterwards.



Camera Settings
---------------

1. **Choose RAW or JPEG.** Nikon: :guilabel:`QUAL` + :guilabel:`rear dial`.

2. **Set the white balance** to incandescent light if you are shooting JPEG.
   Nikon: :guilabel:`WB` + :guilabel:`rear dial`.  This setting has no effect on
   RAW images.

3. **Set the ISO sensitivity.** Use the ISO setting with least noise.  Nikon:
   :guilabel:`ISO` + :guilabel:`rear dial`.  All cameras have one ISO setting
   where the sensor noise is minimal, usually the lowest, but you should check
   with your camera manual or the internet.

4. **Set the lens to manual focus.** Nikon: Push the switch on the lens from
   :guilabel:`M/A` to :guilabel:`M`.

5. **Set the camera to manual exposure.** Nikon: :guilabel:`MODE` +
   :guilabel:`rear dial`.  Use the smallest aperture for maximum depth of field (:term:`DOF`).
   Nikon: :guilabel:`front dial`.  Set the exposure time.  Nikon: :guilabel:`rear dial`.

   You'll have to iteratively adjust the aperture, time and maybe ISO settings
   after taking test runs.  The focus light alone does not give enough guidance
   to set exposure parameters [#]_.  Check for overexposure especially with shiny
   objects.

6. **Turn on exposure delay mode.** Nikon D700: menu :menuselection:`d9`.  This
   mode waits 1 second after lifting the mirror and before actually taking the
   picture thus reducing vibrations.


Dome Setup
----------

1. **Connect the RTI dome to the CRM 114** (Camera to RTI Module) using two
   Cat.5 or better Ethernet cables.

2. **Fit lens and camera to the dome.** Align the camera's vertical axis with
   the 0Â° axis of dome.  A polarizing filter between dome and lens will allow
   you to turn the camera with more ease.

   .. warning::

      You will not get working RTI pictures without correct alignment of dome
      and camera.

3. **Connect the camera to the CRM** using two interface cables.  Connect the
   PC-Flash output on the camera with the flash input on the CRM.  Connect the
   trigger input on the camera with the trigger output on the CRM.

4. **Connect the AC/DC adaptor to the CRM** and plug it into a wall socket.  The
   green light on the CRM should come on.

5. **Turn the camera on.**


Shooting
--------

1. **Put the object under the dome** in the exact center.

2. **Short press the green button** for focus light.  You can short press again
   to turn the focus light off.

3. **Focus the object.** Then close the viewfinder.

4. **Long press the green button** to start the picture run.

The red button resets the CRM.  Use it to abort a shooting run.


Various Notes
-------------

Your mileage will depend on how fast the camera can save the pictures to the
memory card.  Many cameras have a small internal buffer, which fills up after a
short burst, and after that the speed of the memory card limits the frame rate.

Camera vibrations caused by mirror movement can impair the results.  To
reduce camera vibrations use exposure delay mode or live view.

Exposure delay mode does not incur a penalty of one second per exposure.
Depending on the speed of the memory card it may be much less.  If shooting
RAW with a slow memory card the camera will need more than one second to
write the file, thus the penalty will be zero.

For greatest depth of field (:term:`DOF`) use the smallest aperture (that is the
*highest* aperture number) that you can manage.  Most cameras use the largest
aperture for viewing, the DOF you see in the viewfinder is much less than the
DOF you will get on the picture.  In case of a 3D object focus on the middle
ground.

If you want color, place the object onto a :term:`grey card`.  This will make it
a lot easier to find the correct white balance in the raw converter software.


Footnotes
---------

.. [#] The focus light (current shared by N LEDs) has not the same intensity as
       the individual LED (current used by one LED) because LED emission is not
       linear with current.  Also specular lights will be N times brighter if
       the object is lighted by one LED only.
