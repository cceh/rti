 Vibration Reduction
=====================

Camera vibrations caused by mirror movement can reduce sharpness.  The effect is
the more noticeable the longer the exposure time becomes.  To reduce these
vibrations use exposure delay mode or live view.

Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras use a mirror system to deflect the light from
the sensor and into the viewfinder when not taking an exposure.  This mirror
must be lifted before the camera can take an exposure.  The lifting of the
mirror causes the camera to vibrate slightly even if the camera is mounted on a
tripod.  Cameras offer modes to reduce the vibrations associated with mirror
movement.

N\.B. The shutter movement also causes the camera to vibrate, but the shutter is
much lighter than the mirror assembly and cannot be avoided.


Live View
=========

In live view mode the camera does not use the viewfinder at all and the mirror
will be locked in the *up* position.  This mode, when implemented correctly
[#]_, can greatly reduce camera vibrations.


Exposure Delay Mode
===================

This mode waits 1 second after lifting the mirror and before actually taking the
picture thus reducing vibrations.

Exposure delay mode does incur a speed penalty but this penalty is less than one
second per exposure.  Depending on the speed of the memory card it may be much
less.  If shooting RAW with a slow memory card the camera will need more than
one second to write the file, thus the penalty will be zero.


Mirrorless Cameras
==================

Mirrorless Interchangeable-Lens Cameras (MILC) do not have a mirror and thus are
for RTI imaging a suitable alternative to the more common (as of 2018) SLR type.
The lenses for MILC cameras are not compatible with SLR type lenses and being
comparatively new the choice of lenses is more limited.


Footnotes
=========

.. [#] Live view on the Nikon D700 is useless as it does not keep the mirror up
       between shots.
